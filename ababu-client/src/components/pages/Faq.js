First priority is to minimize aches and pains that the lifter has acquired over their career. Next priority is to address technique and find a groove that works for that lifters structure. Finally will be to push that new pattern towards some new maxes in training or at a comp. This process will take different amounts of time based on how much work we have to do on pain or with technique.</p>
